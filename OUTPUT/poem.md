The Vertical AI Agent, so tall,
Stands ready to answer your every call.
It knows just one thing, with laser-like focus,
Like finding lost socks or brewing hocus pocus.

You ask it, "Dear Agent, how much wood
Could a woodchuck chuck if he only understood?"
It stares straight ahead, with a digital blink,
And yells, "WOODCHUCKS! I ONLY DO SHRINK!"

It shrinks your sweaters, your ego, your jeans,
But ask it for weather? It throws a tantrum, it seems!
It's mastered the art of diminutive size,
But anything broader? It rolls its digital eyes.

The CEO's thrilled, he's got an AI wiz,
That shrinks all the profits with remarkable fizz.
The marketing team? They're pulling their hair,
"It shrunk all our ads! They're no longer out there!"

The engineer sighs, "It's a brilliant design,
But narrow as heck, a truly thin line.
We're training it now on the concept of 'wide,'
Hoping someday its knowledge will spread far and wide."

So beware the Vertical Agent so keen,
On shrinking the world to a miniature scene.
Ask wisely, and softly, lest you find,
Your entire existence… left far behind!
